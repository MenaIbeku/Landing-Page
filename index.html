											I deploy sensor technology to determine nutritional data, assisting Massachusetts cranberry farmers in optimizing crop production and guiding senior management decisions for enhanced agricultural productivity.</p>

											<p>As a Full Stack Development Intern at the National Center for Technology and Dispute Resolution from September 2023 to January 2024, I utilized Flutter to develop a disaster response app for medical responders, with a focus on continuous improvement and modification.
											 I implemented solutions to enhance communication efficiency in low connectivity areas, improving disaster response coordination. 
											 Additionally, I developed and integrated geolocation services to identify support hotspots efficiently and supported the development of applications aimed at enhancing security-based community resilience efforts.</p>
<p>As a Data Analytics Intern at Niger Delta Power Holding Company in July 2021, I collected, recorded, and analyzed power distribution and sales data using MS Excel and Access. 
	I represented the data in visual formats, which were utilized to support senior management in daily presentations.</p>
